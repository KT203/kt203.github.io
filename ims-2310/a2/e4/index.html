Additional Funtion 
  My decision to add a fullscreen function is based on the video content itself. Since the main content is sound paired
  with abstract imagery, I imagine users might use this video for background music and visual. For example, if I am
  in gruop study session and want to put this vieo on the projector screen I would want the ability to make it fullscreen. 
  By imaging in what scenario a user might engage with this particular media I was able to create a potential funtion 
  that will inform how a user might interact with the video player. 

CSS chioces:
  I have changed the fullscreen button to the furthest left of the vidoe control bar. I have chosen to do this
  because other video players like Youtube, Netflix etc all have the fullscreen button on the bottom right corner. 
  There is already a standard and expectation of a fullscreen button being of the bottom right corner. Placing it any
  where else might inturrupt the intuitiveness of the webplayer which is not ideal. The design funtion should fade into 
  the background of everyday users unless the goal is to draw attention to the standardised placement of functions like
  the fullscreen button. 

  I have also added a small enlarging animation when hovering over the button  as a way to subtly inform users 
  of the intercatablility of the button. I have chosen this specific visual signifier because it a representation of 
  what the button will do/does. It enlarges. Of all the methods I could have chosen this was the most suitable
