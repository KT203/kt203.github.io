The idea was to create an interactive website focusing on the words Playful and Feedback. The concept involved creating a digital connect the dots activity where the webpage only starts with one dot on the viewport and as users click on it the next dot will be triggered to appear. This is to indicate that the initial dot has been successfully interacted with and to also prompt users to click on the next dot. <br>

I did not get very far due to personal issues, but I will go over my main challenges. 
I was struggling to figure how to get the array to work as I was confusing myself with how the logic of array will work when I apply it my specific project. I even tired drawing it out with pen and paper. When that wasnâ€™t working, I also utilize the help of ChatGPT to see how my idea can be done using another method. However, I also did not get very far with it. 
In general, I had lots of issues with getting one element to work in tandem with the other aspect. Especially as I was trying to style the position of the button/stars it often interfered with the model pop-up. I was getting more frustrated as I was trying to get the different section to work together smoothly. <br>

All in all this project did not go as planned.
