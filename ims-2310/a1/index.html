            <h3>Questions</h3> 

                <p id="Q1">
                    <b>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</b>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        The first thing I paid attention to is the layout and the vertical green bars. There was also a rotating X on the bottom right corner. There was the Title and authors on the top left corner on the page and a mute button on the top right corner. 
                        <br>
                        Which initiated the poem flashing by word by word accompanied by a low bell sound for each word. After the first poem I continued on to the next.
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p id="Q2">
                    <b>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions</b>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Since there was feedback as I hover my mouse over the bars it drew me to click on them. Which initiated the poem flashing by word by word accompanied by a low bell sound for each word. After the first poem I continued on to the next.</li>
                        <li>I got bored and clicked around a lot. I had multiple poems playing at once. </li>
                        <li>There was a rotating X on the bottom right corner that when I hover over brought up a menu list of poems and I randomly clicked on.</li>
                        <li>It led me to an interactive poem Affirmations for My Existence by Zainab Aliyu. </li>
                        <li>Instinctively I clicked around.</li>
                        <li>Instinctively I clicked around.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p id="Q3">
                    <b>3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</b>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        Initially I spent the most time trying to figure out the purpose of the website and to map out the website. I quickly went through and interacted with anything that could be interacted with. Another part I spent a lot of time on was trying to figure out how to get back to the initial page after clicking on one of the poems listed in the blue menu. 
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p id="Q4">
                    <b>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</b>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        My most common action in the first two minute interaction with the website is randomly clicking around trying to pause some of the poems to read them but couldnâ€™t. A lot of time was spent on navigation. 
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p id="Q5">
                    <b>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</b>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        My initial impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience is that it is trying to translate poems into a digital performance and experience to enhance the experience of the poems. 
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p id="Q6">
                    <b>6. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</b>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        I think that given no context of what the website is it can be hard to navigate and understand the purpose of the website at first glance. However, the idea, layout and construction of the interaction of some poems are done in an intuitive way and does enhance the experience of the poems. 
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p id="Q7">
                    <b>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</b>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        After a few interaction and reloading the pages (about 15 mins) I think more time should be spent on the first initial page before going into the list of poems. As per my experience, taking the time to go through the 7 poems gave me a better understanding with the interaction of the poems and movement of the poems. So when I went on into the other poems it made more sense as to what I was looking at. Maybe having a home button that brought the user back to the initial page could be helpful cause many of the other pages had no obvious pause button or non at all and it kept going. This stressed me out and I could not focus on the purpose of the poems. 
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p id="Q8">
                    <b>8. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</b>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        After gaining a better understanding of the interactive experience, I think the initial page  7 poems  is made as a type of tutorial. The user is meant to to go through the poems on the page (left to right and top to bottom) and play around before going to the X on the bottom right corner that led to more interactive poems pages. The layout make sense in that way 
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p id="Q9">
                    <b>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</b>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        The reference for the website is drawn from poetry and slam poetry. I believe it is trying to create the effect of rhythm and theatrics that you get from a slam poetry performance. Also with traditionally written poetry there techniques and methods to create/convey rhythm. 
                        <br>
                        By using an interactive website platform, the art of poetry can be  translated and adapted into a digital format that combine the written element of traditional poetry and the audio of slam poetry.
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p id="Q10">
                    <b>10. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</b>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        When engaging with the website the sound that indicate rhythm is really important to the poem. The website flashes one word of the poem at the time so the sound is crucial in creating a beat for the poem which emphasise the impact of the poem. Knowing about the nature of poetry every beat the website creates is important to the poem and not just the words.
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p id="Q11">
                    <b>11. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</b>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        Slam poetry is a performance so once you hit play on the poem it is best to enjoy it like a performance.  
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p id="Q12">
                    <b>12. What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</b>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        The single word playing made it hard to experience the poem as a whole. The words went by really fast which makes it hard to read.  When I first engaged with the website I was too distracted to properly experience and appreciate the poems. 
                        <br>
                        Additionally, as I was exploring the website and the different links, I found it very frustrating that I could not return to the initial webpage and had to used the initial link again.
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p id="Q13">
                    <b>13. What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</b>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        When I finally understood the the aim of the website I could better enjoy the poems. Being able to experience poetry through a different delivery method was interesting and fun.
                    </ul>
                </p>
